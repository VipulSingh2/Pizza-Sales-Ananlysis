# Pizza-Sales-Ananlysis-Using Python
Welcome to the Pizza Sales Analysis project! This project leverages Streamlit for creating interactive visualizations and data analysis of pizza sales. The analysis includes various KPIs and graphical representations to provide insights into sales trends, popular pizzas, and more.
Introduction
This project aims to analyze pizza sales data using interactive visualizations. It uses Python libraries such as pandas, Streamlit, and matplotlib, along with a custom visual module for preprocessing and plotting.

Features
Interactive Dashboard: View various KPIs and graphical representations of the data.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
Sales Metrics: Display total sales, total orders, and total pizzas sold.
Top and Worst Ordered Pizzas: Visualize the most and least popular pizzas.
Category and Size Distribution: Pie charts showing the distribution of pizza categories and sizes.
Daily and Hourly Trends: Bar and line charts illustrating sales trends over time.
